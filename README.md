## Project Description

You're planning a surprise birthday party for a friend who loves escape rooms and puzzles. To practice your coding skills, you have built an application that can encode and decode various types of messages. This application, known as the "Decoder Ring," will assist you in creating fun and challenging puzzles for your friend to solve.

Throughout this project, it is recommended to follow a Test-Driven Development (TDD) process. Writing tests can help you focus your workflow and ensure the correctness of your code.

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to build an application that satisfies the following requirements:

1. Pass all the tests in the Qualified assessment.
2. Implement the specified algorithms correctly for encoding and decoding messages.
3. Write unit tests using Mocha and Chai to verify the accuracy of your algorithms.
4. Handle various scenarios, including different shift values, capital letters, non-alphabetic characters, and maintaining spaces before and after encoding or decoding.
5. Ensure the project meets all the criteria outlined in the project rubric.

## Technologies Used

The following technologies were used to develop the Decoder Ring application:

- JavaScript
- Mocha
- Chai
